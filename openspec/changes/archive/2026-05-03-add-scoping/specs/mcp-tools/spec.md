## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Optional scope parameter on every existing tool
Every existing query tool (`find_definition`, `find_references`, `list_symbols_in_file`, `list_callers`, `list_callees`, `search_symbols`, `neighborhood`, `module_summary`, `impact_of_change`, `graph_stats`, `usage_stats`) SHALL accept an optional `scope` parameter (a string id, a string array, or the literal `"*"` for all non-isolated scopes).

#### Scenario: Default behaviour
- **WHEN** any tool is invoked without a `scope` argument
- **THEN** the query runs against the configured `default_scope` (or the single registered scope when none is configured), and the response notes the implicit scope it queried

#### Scenario: Explicit single scope
- **WHEN** a tool is invoked with `scope = "backend"`
- **THEN** results come from the `backend` scope only

#### Scenario: Explicit multi-scope
- **WHEN** a tool is invoked with `scope = ["frontend", "backend"]`
- **THEN** results from both scopes are merged by `canonical_key`, each row tagged with the scopes it came from

#### Scenario: Wildcard scope
- **WHEN** a tool is invoked with `scope = "*"`
- **THEN** results come from every non-isolated scope; isolated scopes are excluded unless listed explicitly

### Requirement: Scope identity in result rows
Every result row from a scope-aware query SHALL include the originating scope (or sorted list of scopes) so the agent can filter on its side without a second call.

#### Scenario: Result row carries scope
- **WHEN** `find_references(symbol = "X", scope = "*")` returns rows from two scopes
- **THEN** each row's markdown includes `scope: <name>` (or `scope: [<a>, <b>]` for canonical_key dedup)
